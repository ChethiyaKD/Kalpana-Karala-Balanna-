# About
<p> The search engine features a rebranded interface, replacing the familiar Google branding with Sinhala words "Kalpana Karala", which translates to "Think". In addition, the usual Google search buttons, reading "Google Search" and "I'm feeling lucky", have been altered to read "Balanna" and "Nadda Ha".  These words are synonymous with Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of the National People's Power, who frequently uses them in his political speeches.</p>

</br>

<p> On Friday, software Engineer Chethiya Kusal took Rajapakshe's creation a step further by launching the search engine as a Google extension. Now, users who download and activate the extension on Google Chrome can use this politically-inspired search engine as they browse the web. </p>
